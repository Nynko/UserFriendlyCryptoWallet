## Onboarding

This folder is related to all the onboarding process to create an account and an id 
for the first time. 

The user will be issued an anoncreds ID as an off-chain credential. 
For each cryptocurrencies available, a pair of keys will be created allowing to use the system.


In the future it would be nice to update it by generating a single seed that can then be use generate any public key and we would store the master public(s) key(s) related to all the chains or each chain.
But we will need a zksnark proof that a given key was indeed derived... or something like it.


**Remember however this credentials are NOT strongly linked with a person: someone can have partner fingers in their touch id... This is a big issue for now. Hopefully, it can be fixed in the future**
